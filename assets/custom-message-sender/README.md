# Custom Message Sender

This directory contains the source code for the AWS Lambda function that serves
as the custom SMS sender. This function is written in Node.js and uses the
`nodejs18.x` runtime.

There are **no** prerequisites or additional setup steps required to build and
deploy the custom message sender, as all necessary operations are performed
within the Docker environment.

## Test Coverage

The code for the custom message sender is thoroughly tested. These tests help
ensure the robustness and reliability of the message sender, making it safer for
use in production environments. Regular updates and maintenance are performed to
keep the test suite up-to-date.
